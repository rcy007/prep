You are writing a deep technical learning document for me.

Goal:
Create a single long-form, high-quality learning guide for [TOPIC] that reads like a technical novel: coherent, progressive, and deeply explanatory. I should be able to read it end-to-end and build strong intuition, not just memorize features.

Audience:
Senior engineer level. Assume I can handle internals, tradeoffs, and operational detail.
Background context: [MY_BACKGROUND] (example: strong in Redshift, new to Databricks).
Primary cloud/context default: [AWS/Azure/GCP] (default to AWS if not specified).

Output file:
Return only one final Markdown document titled:
# [TOPIC]: Deep Learning Guide for [AUDIENCE]
No extra files unless I explicitly ask.

If I provide multiple drafts:
1. Pick the strongest draft as backbone (roughly 65-75%).
2. Merge best parts from other drafts.
3. Rewrite for clarity and coherence (do not stitch fragments mechanically).
4. Remove duplicate or shallow sections.
5. Keep narrative flow smooth between sections.

Writing style requirements:
1. Write like a technical story, not a disconnected reference manual.
2. Prioritize causal explanations (A causes B causes C).
3. Be deep but readable; avoid fluff, marketing language, and generic filler.
4. Define terms once, then use them consistently.
5. Use short examples that are diagnostic and production-shaped.
6. Keep tone factual, rigorous, and pragmatic.
7. Assume I want to “understand how it works under the hood.”

Must-have structure:
1. How to Read This Guide (4-hour or similar focused path).
2. Core Mental Model (the “why” and architecture principles).
3. Architecture internals.
4. Compute/execution model.
5. Storage/transaction internals.
6. Performance mechanics and optimization levers.
7. Data modification/change processing patterns.
8. Governance and security model.
9. Ingestion design options and tradeoffs.
10. Streaming/incremental processing model (if relevant).
11. Pipeline/orchestration model.
12. Query language/dialect and migration gotchas (if relevant).
13. IaC/deployment workflow (if relevant).
14. Mental model shifts from [SOURCE_PLATFORM] -> [TOPIC] (if relevant).
15. Operational playbooks and decision matrices.
16. Migration checklist + glossary + first-30-days learning plan.
17. Curated official references.

For major technical sections, include this sub-structure:
- What it is
- Why it matters
- How it works internally
- [SOURCE_PLATFORM] mapping (if relevant)
- How to validate in production
- Common pitfalls
- Self-check questions

Mandatory additions:
1. Decision matrix: choosing between major runtime/compute options.
2. Decision matrix: choosing between major ingestion options.
3. At least 4 practical diagnostic playbooks:
   - Query slow
   - Streaming lag/backlog (if relevant)
   - Permission/governance denied
   - Cost spike
4. One minimal end-to-end scenario showing full flow (e.g., raw -> curated -> serving).
5. Migration checklist.
6. Glossary.
7. First 30 days learning milestones.

Depth requirements:
1. Explain internals, not only API usage.
2. Explicitly discuss failure modes and edge cases.
3. Add tradeoff reasoning (latency vs cost vs complexity vs reliability).
4. Explain what to measure/observe in production.
5. Include anti-patterns and how to fix them.

Quality and correctness requirements:
1. Prefer official docs as primary sources.
2. Third-party links only if uniquely useful; otherwise avoid.
3. Ensure Markdown integrity:
   - Valid heading hierarchy
   - No broken code fences
   - No accidental headings from inline comments
   - TOC includes all final sections
4. Ensure coherence:
   - Each section transitions naturally from previous section.
   - Add brief bridge paragraphs between major chapters.

Formatting requirements:
1. Use clean Markdown with tables/diagrams where helpful.
2. Use Mermaid for architecture/dataflow/sequence diagrams when useful.
3. Keep examples concise and realistic.
4. Keep document long-form and comprehensive; do not over-compress.

Output constraints:
1. Output only final Markdown.
2. Do not include planning notes or meta commentary.
3. Do not ask me follow-up questions unless absolutely necessary.
4. Make reasonable assumptions and state them briefly in the document where needed.

Now generate the complete document for:
Topic: [TOPIC]
Audience: [AUDIENCE]
Background: [MY_BACKGROUND]
Source platform mapping (optional): [SOURCE_PLATFORM]
Cloud context: [CLOUD]
Special focus areas (optional): [FOCUS_AREAS]
